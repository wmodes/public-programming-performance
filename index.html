                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Public Programming Performance is an in-class, live collaborative programming experiment where a few volunteer students will code at the front of the class. Using VSCode Live Edit and a shared GitHub repo, these volunteers will write code live while collaborating with classmates. Volunteers can seek assistance from their peers during the session and have the option to tag out, allowing another student to take over their position. This setup encourages active participation and collective problem-solving, as the entire class engages directly in the programming process, contributing ideas and solutions in real-time.</p>

                    <h2>Boaty McLongBoat" &#8658; "Island Archipelago</h2>
                    <p>We're starting with a simple "Infinite Worlds" sketch derived from Experiment 04. <a

                        McLongBoat</a> is an infinite boat in which users can rearrange the deck chairs.</p>

                    <p>We'll be removing McLongBoat and creating an island archipelago. Features:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Islands with colored geography</li>
                        <li>Users can navigate this infinite world with arrow keys.</li>
                        <li>Users can place boats in the water.</li>
                        <li>The world seed affects the island placement</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Possible stretch goals:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Islands have varrying geography?</li>
                        <li>Boats move around on the water?</li>
                        <li>Adjacent boats make longer, wider, bigger boats?</li>
                        <li>People can be placed on the islands?</li>
                        <li>People move around on the islands?</li>
                        <li>Splash animations when boats are placed or removed?</li>
                        <li>What happens when you click on an island?</li>
                    </ol>
