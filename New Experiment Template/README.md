# Boaty McLongBoat

- **Infinity**: This scene represents an infinitely long cruise ship traveling through the ocean.
- **Variation in space**: The water is based on Perlin noise and it animates with variation in space off to infinity.
- **Variation in key**: Different world generation keys (names of the boat??) lead to specific trim colors for the boat.r
- **Signs of life**: The water is naturalistically moving and the audience can rearrange deck chairs on their boat by _clicking on boat tiles_.
